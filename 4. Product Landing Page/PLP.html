                    <h1>How Our Beans are Harvested</h1>
                    <p class="harvest-info">As a artisan coffee company, we take great pride in our harvesting process. Our coffee beans are hand-picked at the peak of ripeness to ensure the highest quality and flavor.</p>
                    <p class="harvest-info">Once the coffee cherries are picked, they are carefully sorted to remove any underripe or overripe beans. The beans are then placed in small batches and undergo a thorough inspection to ensure that only the finest beans are selected for our coffee blends.</p>
                    <p class="harvest-info">Next, the coffee beans are carefully cleaned and dried, using traditional techniques to preserve their unique flavors and aromas. This slow and meticulous process results in coffee beans that are bursting with flavor and aroma, ready to be roasted to perfection.</p>
                    <p class="harvest-info">Our commitment to quality and tradition extends to every step of our harvesting process, ensuring that each and every cup of coffee we serve is of the highest caliber.</p>
